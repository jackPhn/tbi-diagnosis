2. Overall Description
    2.1 User Needs
    The user of this system are medical personnels who operate a Terason ultrasound system
    to dianose patients with suspected brain injuries. The machine learning model will be
    deployed on the Terason system and provide overlaid dianostic information on standard
    b-mode ultrasound.

    2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
        2.2.1   Assumptions
        -   The input data (images) will be similar in size before processing.
        2.2.2   Dependencies
        -   Processing capability of the Terason system.
        -   Quality of the input ultrasound data.
