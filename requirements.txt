1.  Introduction
    1.1 Purpose
    This document describes the system-level requirements of the TBI Diagnosis system.

    1.2 Intended Audiance
    This document is intended for the developer(s)/stake holders of the software system.

    1.3 Indented Use
    This document is indented to describe and track the system-level requirements of the
    TBI Diagnosis system.

    1.4 Scope
    The scope includes Functional, External Interface, and Nonfunctional requirements.

    1.5 Definition and Acronyms
    N/A


2. Overall Description
    2.1 User Needs
    The user of this system are medical personnels who operate a Terason ultrasound system
    to dianose patients with suspected brain injuries. The machine learning model will be
    deployed on the Terason system and provide overlaid dianostic information on standard
    b-mode ultrasound.

    2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
        2.2.1   Assumptions
        -   The input data (images) will be similar in size before processing.
        2.2.2   Dependencies
        -   Processing capability of the Terason system.
        -   Quality of the input ultrasound data.

3. System Features and Requirements
    3.1 Data 
        Tissue pulsatility ultrasound

    3.2 Functional Requirements
        3.2.1   Minimum performance level
        3.2.3   Specificity
        3.2.4   Sensitivity
        3.2.5   Dice coefficient

    3.3 External Interface Requirements
        N/A

    3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
        3.4.1   Maximum inference speed

Detection of at least of one blob of bleed of one 1cm across.
next to the skull or away from the skull
GCS score: glasgow coma scale
Is there something big and bloody? Small little things dont matter much
Which scans/patients show large blobs of bleed?
How large is a lession to be serious? Depends on the type of TBI.
    Starting from 1cm, it becomes problematic
Whether the bleed is away from the skull or closer to the skull?

Thinking about doing cloud computing with will
Get information from Jon as soon as possible

The task could be: yes or no if there is a bleed in the image of the size >= 1cm

If the GCS score is high enough, surgery could save the patient. The output of the model
    could be a decision whether surgery is necessary.

GCS and CT are used to evaluate if a patient should go for surgery. We want to subtitude
    CT with ultrasound.
