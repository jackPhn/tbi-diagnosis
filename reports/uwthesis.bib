	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}), according to the World Health Organization, will surpass many diseases as the major cause of death and disability by the year 2020. With an estimated 10 million people affected annually by {TBI}, the burden of mortality and morbidity that this condition imposes on society, makes {TBI} a pressing public health and medical problem. The burden of {TBI} is manifest throughout the world, and is especially prominent in Low and Middle Income Countries which face a higher preponderance of risk factors for causes of {TBI} and have inadequately prepared health systems to address the associated health outcomes. Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa demonstrate a higher {TBI}-related incidence rate varying from 150–170 per 100,000 respectively due to {RTIs} compared to a global rate of 106 per 100,000. As highlighted in this global review of {TBI}, there is a large gap in data on incidence, risk factors, sequelae, ﬁnancial costs, and social impact of {TBI}. This should be addressed through planning of comprehensive {TBI} prevention programs in {LMICs} through well-established surveillance systems. Greater resources for research and prioritized interventions are critical to promote evidence-based policy for {TBI}.},

	abstract = {Tissue pulsatility imaging ({TPI}) is an ultrasonic technique that is being developed at the University of Washington to measure tissue displacement or strain as a result of blood ﬂow over the cardiac and respiratory cycles. This technique is based in principle on plethysmography, an older nonultrasound technology for measuring expansion of a whole limb or body part due to perfusion. {TPI} adapts tissue Doppler signal processing methods to measure the “plethysmographic” signal from hundreds or thousands of sample volumes in an ultrasound image plane. This paper presents a feasibility study to determine if {TPI} can be used to assess cerebral vasoreactivity. Ultrasound data were collected transcranially through the temporal acoustic window from four subjects before, during and after voluntary hyperventilation. In each subject, decreases in tissue pulsatility during hyperventilation were observed that were statistically correlated with the subject’s end-tidal {CO}2 measurements.
